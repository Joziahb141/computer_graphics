> From time to time it is useful to write out a formula in a readable way. In obsidian this can be done using LaTex or Mathjax. 
> Simply enclose laTex code in `$` for inline or `$$` for a code block e.g.
> ```laTex 
> $$
> \begin{bmatrix}
> \hat{i}_x & \hat{j}_x \\ 
> \hat{i}_y & \hat{j}_y

## Notes: 
common to reference to vectors as points when dealing with multiple vectors rather than arrows
basis vectors: vectors used as references for our values with default in 2d being $\hat{i}$ and $\hat{j}$ so the equation these points are equal to a$\hat{i}$ + b$\hat{j}$
when dealing with space choose separate scalers and reference those
two vectors with same scalers points form a line in 2d/ 3d space
two vectors with unique scalars form a grid/ selection of points in 2d space and these form a plain in 3d space
three vectors with unique scalers form a plain that can move through an access or multiple access on the 3d grid making it possible to cover every possible point in space/ every possible 3d vector
